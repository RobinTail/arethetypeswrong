 (ignoring resolutions: 'node10')

(ignored per resolution) 💀 Import failed to resolve to type declarations or JavaScript files. https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/NoResolution.md

❌ Import resolved to JavaScript files, but no type declarations were found. https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/UntypedResolution.md

⚠️ A require call resolved to an ESM JavaScript file, which is an error in Node and some bundlers. CommonJS consumers will need to use a dynamic import. https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/CJSResolvesToESM.md
